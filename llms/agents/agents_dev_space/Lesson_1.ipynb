    "Before we dive into building agents, let's set up a new folder structure with ADK's built-in project scaffolding using the `adk create` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run `adk create`, it generates three essential files. \n",
    "1. The `.env` file securely stores your API credentials and configuration. \n",
    "2. The `__init__.py` file marks the directory as a Python package, nabling proper imports. \n",

    "\n",
    "ADK create supports two project types. The `--type=code` option generates a Python-based agent in `agent.py`. The `--type=config` option creates a YAML-based agent configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `--model` parameter specifies the LLM to be used by the agent. We will override this and experiment with different models as we create the agents in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up authentication\n",

    "Before using any AI models, the first step is to configure API credentials. There are several methods to authenticate with Google's Gemini models, including:\n",

    "For more information on setting up your own authentication, visit [Google](https://cloud.google.com/free?hl=en). \n",
